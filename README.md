# PLM-perturbations

As it says in the code itself, it comes from a paper (also attached) with some explanation in supplementary document (also attached). The code needs a dataset to run and that is also attached (DATA_PLM.csv).

In short, this is a “fitting” problem to describe lactation curves (of goats in this case). We have done it and even have the “curve fitting” tool online that is somehow like it. The main difference is that in this paper they introduce “perturbations” as part of the fitting problem. At this point what I would like to be able to do is to reproduce what the paper reports. Then later we could use to apply to the development of a tool.
