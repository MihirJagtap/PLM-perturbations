## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
source("PLM_Model.R")

Cow.data <- read.csv("DATA_PLM.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(Cow.data)
```
```{r}
NMAX = 15
compute_plm(Cow.data, NMAX)
  

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
